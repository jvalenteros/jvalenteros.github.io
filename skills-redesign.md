# Skills Section Redesign

## Current Structure Analysis
- Skills are organized in categories (Development, Design)
- Each skill has a name and progress bar
- Progress bars show skill proficiency level
- Layout uses CSS grid for categories

## Redesign Plan
- Keep the category structure
- Remove progress bars
- Create an aesthetic grid of skill tags
- Use colored borders for visual appeal
- Add hover effects for interactivity
- Maintain minimalist terminal aesthetic
